  <h1><strong>OPEN DATA LICENCE AT A FAIR COST FOR COMMERCIAL RE-USE</strong></h1>

  <h2>Licence</h2>
  <hr>
  <p><strong> </strong>This licence contains the terms and conditions for the re-use of datasets owned by an entity
    which are made available as &lsquo;open data&rsquo; for commercial use at a fair cost. By exercising the rights
    granted under this licence in respect to the provided dataset (the &lsquo;product&rsquo;), the licensee accepts

  <h3>Article 4. Obligations of the licensee</h3>
  <hr>
  The licensee commits to abiding by the provisions of this licence.
  
  <p>The licensee commits to attributing the source for every re-use of the product, as specified by the licensor. In
    absence of such a specification, the licensee shall indicate the name of the licensor and, if possible, the date
    or year of the product. Where it is reasonably not practical to include all attributions because of the
    combination of works from different sources or licensors, the following specification may be included: &ldquo;Contains
    public sector information obtained under the Open Data Licence at a Fair Cost for Commercial Re-Use Flanders v.
    1.1&rdquo;. </p>

  <p>The licensee commits to avoiding any unlawful re-use of the product. He or she commits to not giving the

    official status or was endorsed by the licensor. </p>

  <p>The licensee commits in the re-use of the product not to infringe on the legislation that is in force with regard
    to the protection of personal details, or on any other legal provision. </p>

  <h3>Article 5. Intellectual property rights</h3>

  <p>The licensor retains all intellectual property rights to the product, except the rights which are explicitly
    granted to the licensee in this licence. </p>

  <p>The licensee retains all intellectual property rights to the works he or she creates on the basis of the product,
    without prejudice, however, to the obligations regarding the re-use of the product in these works, as described
    in this licence. </p>

  <h3>Article 6. Price</h3>

    guidelines. </p>
