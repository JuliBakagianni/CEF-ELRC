<h2>Provision of LRs in the ELRC context</h2>
<div class="content_box">
<p>The CEF-ELRC META-SHARE repository is intended for documenting, storing, browsing and accessing LRs that are considered useful for feeding the CEF.AT platform.</p>
<p>You are welcome to document and upload any LRs that you have identified as useful for this purpose. The <a href="http://www.lr-coordination.eu" target="_blank">ELRC action</a> is looking for open data that can be made available for re-use through open data initiatives, but also for commercially available datasets.</p>
<p>The LR descriptions (metadata) are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) version 4.0 or higher. All LR providers are obliged to allow the harvesting of their metadata.</p>

<div id="Procedure_for_LR_provision" class="anchor"></div>
<h2>Steps to follow for providing LRs</h2>
<div class="content_box">
<p>All registered users have editor privileges, i.e. they can describe and upload LRs at the CEF-ELRC META-SHARE repository.</p>
<p>To do so, the following procedure is used:</p>
<ul>
	<li>First register <a href="../accounts/create/">here</a>; a valid email address is required for this process. Once you obtain the account credentials, you can log in and use the editor (cf. menu item: "Manage your own resources").</li>
	<li>For each LR you provide, you must document it with a minimum of information, in accordance to the CEF-ELRC metadata schema (adapted from the META-SHARE schema).</li>
	<li>Each LR description must include the licensing terms under which the LR is provided - cf. <a href="#Licensing_LRs">below</a>.</li>
    <li>You can upload the LR itself at the repository as a zipped file, again using the editor.</li>
	<li>During the documentation process, all LR descriptions are considered "internal" and can only be viewed and edited by you. Once you have finished the documentation of the LR, you can "ingest" them. Ingested LR descriptions are viewed and checked by the CEF-ELRC managers before being published at the CEF-ELRC inventory.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="Licensing_LRs" class="anchor"></div>
<h2>Licensing LRs for the ELRC action</h2>
<div class="content_box">
<p>Any grant of access to LRs through the CEF-ELRC META-SHARE repository should include not only the right to read the relevant content but also to allow transformative uses, dissemination and distribution of such resources 
and their derivatives, according to the needs and policies of LR owners and users.</p>
<p>To limit the complexity of licensing, we strongly advise LR providers to use one of the standard open licences, i.e. <b>Creative Commons</b> and open national licences. If, however, the LR comes with another licence, the LR provider is responsible for documenting the licence in the metadata and ensuring its terms and conditions are clearly available to all repository users.</p>
    <p>
A <a href="http://www.lr-coordination.eu/helpdesk" target="_blank">helpdesk facility</a> has been set up for assistance in understanding, choosing and using any of these licence and other legal tools.</p>
<p>The rights of use of the resource, any possible restrictions, as well as rights and restrictions on the original raw data are under the control and responsibility of the resource owners. The repository in which the resource resides acts mainly as a facilitator for the search-and-get procedure while providing guidelines and metadata curation activities.</p>
<p>Metadata elements regarding rights of use, availability and distribution are among the mandatory elements of the minimal metadata schema and are shown to users (essentially language resource consumers) so that they can promptly understand what they are allowed to do with a specific resource. Users are asked to always refer to these metadata before using any of the resources on this repository.</p>
</div>

<div id="Notice_and_Take_Down_Policy" class="anchor"></div>
<h2>Notice and Take Down Policy</h2>
<div class="content_box">
<p>If a rights holder is concerned that s/he has found Language Resources (LRs) on the CEF-ELRC META-SHARE repository, for which s/he has not given permission, granted a licence or is not covered by a limitation or
 exception in national law, such rights holder is asked to contact CEF-ELRC through the Legal Helpdesk ({% encrypt_email 'help@cef-at-helpdesk.org' %}) in writing, stating the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>His/Her contact details;</li>
  <li>The full bibliographic details of the LR;</li>
  <li>The exact and full URL where s/he found the LR;</li>
  <li>Proof that s/he is the rights holder and a statement that, under penalty of perjury, s/he is the rights holder or an authorised representative.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon receipt of notification the <b>Notice and Takedown</b> procedure is then invoked as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>CEF-ELRC will acknowledge receipt of the complaint by email or letter and will make an initial assessment of its validity and plausibility.</li>
  <li>Upon receipt of a valid complaint, the LR will be temporarily removed from the CEF-ELRC catalogue pending an agreed solution.</li>
  <li>The Legal Helpdesk will contact the individual who deposited the material within ten working days from the reception of a valid complaint. The LR provider will be notified that the material is subject to a complaint, under what allegations, and will be encouraged to assuage the  complaints concerned.</li>
  <li>The complainant and the LR provider will be encouraged to resolve the issue swiftly and amicably and to the satisfaction of both parties, with the following possible outcomes:
    <ul>
      <li>The LR is replaced on the CEF-ELRC inventory unchanged.</li>
      <li>The LR is replaced on the CEF-ELRC inventory with changes.</li>
      <li>The LR is permanently removed from the CEF-ELRC inventory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the LR provider and the complainant are unable to agree on a solution, the LR will remain unavailable through the CEF-ELRC inventory until a time when a resolution has been reached.</li>
</ol>
